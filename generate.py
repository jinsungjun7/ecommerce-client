## Generate directories for each location
# name = ["earth", "moon", "neptune", "pluto", "saturn", "uranus", "mars"]

# for i in name:
#     os.mkdir(i)


## Rename files for each so it is sequential
# name = ["earth", "moon", "neptune", "pluto", "saturn", "uranus", "mars"]
# 2 for loops -> 1 outer for name and another which creates an array of all the files in each directory and renames them with name+count
